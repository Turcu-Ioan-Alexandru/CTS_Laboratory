Guidelines: 
- It is better to use an enum than multiple static final ints
- You should name most of your variables according to the Lower Camel Case naming convention 
(avoid using _ unless the variable is a static one). The same thing applies to functions
- Avoid using tabs in the same line of code, the spacing makes the lines hard to read
- Don't declare variables that you are not going to use (ex: int temp = 365, int vb = 10) 
- Override the existing toString() function rather than create a new one yourself
- Create your own exception classes
